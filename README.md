    Here i will be uploading all the basic and maybe adanvanced algorithms in future 
    
   1 Selection sort : 
   
   Algorithm for this is -
 a) create an array or ask the user for it(for practice we're just using a simple integer array,in c++ we can even sort character arrays)
 b) use the concept of double pointers to traverse the list(array)
 c) assume the 1st pointer is pointing to the smallest element
 d) if yes then good if no then swap them 
 e) keep on doing this while keeping one poiter stable at the index where we want to fill the smallest
    or next smallest element and use the other pointer to traverse the list
